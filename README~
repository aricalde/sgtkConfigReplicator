csTankReplicator
Tool to replicate tank project configs to various projects.

Here at Cluster Studio we have many projects running in parallel, and
some times we need a patch in the Tank config for all of them, so we
build this app to simplify the process of replicate configs between
projects.

The app get a list of projects where you select origin and target
projects, then specify what config folders will be synchronized.


You have a config file, where you configure different jobs(folders)
that will be replicated from one project to the others.

 - jobs_config.yml
 
 	The configs are based on the PyYAML syntax, so you need
 	to have this module.
 	
 	Each job has the following structure:
 	
 	'''
 	
	 Schema-Templates:
	  path: /tank/config/core/
	  exclutions:
	  - 'hooks'
	  - 'install_location.yml'
	  - 'pipeline_configuration.yml'
	  - 'roots.yml'
	  
	'''

The app have three modules:

 - get_projects_list.py
 
 	This one finds all the projects from and to where you
 	want to synchronize configs. If you need your custom
 	behavior, edit this file.

	Also if you want to work with its default functionality,
	you will need to change the Shotgun API conection values,
	and maybe the filters to get the projects.

 - sync_job.py
 	
 	This module manage the folder replication for each job, in
 	our case select rsync, but configure it as you need.
 	
 -build_path.py
 
 	This module gets the job and project paths and based on a
 	type that can be "origin" or "target", builds a valid path
 	to be used in the replicate job.
 	
 	Also, this module use the origin and target projects paths
 	specified in the jobs_config.yml
